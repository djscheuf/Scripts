# Scripts
This is a collection of my personal script tools. I have been crafting them here and there over my years a developer.
I finally got tired of moving them via USB whenever I changed computers or  jobs so I setup a repo for them.

If you find them useful, I invite you to borrow and repurpose them.
At presently, I am doing my best to redact company specific information from them.
As a result some configuration files will be missing. I hope to later provide an empty config file as appropriate.

Until then, Good hunting!
