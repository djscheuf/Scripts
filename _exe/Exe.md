## ~~[Restore Personalization](/_exe)
__Lanugage: C#__
This small exe was created to, as its name suggests, restore some personailiztion on my work computer.
IT had some kind of service that would continually change my log-out screen and User Profile pic.
This EXE can be run to simply save over their changes and restore my personalizations.
It uses pictures in the rsr folder as the over-rides for the IT changed files.
*At the moment, these have not be uploaded, due to some concern over copyright.*

At present the file names are hard-coded, as are the replacement file names. But it is a simple solution for a simple problem.
*Version 2 may upgrade this to a Windows service* ~~
